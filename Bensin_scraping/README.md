# Bensin Scraping

## What is this?
This is a small project I made in November of 2020 where I webscrape the webpage bensinpriser.nu for user inputed petrol prices for gas stations. The website doesn't have any way to access it's historical data so I though I'd create one of my own. 
It contains the names and adress of the gas station, colour(which represent the type of user that inputed the price), Price, Date Entered (into the website), and Date Collected (which is when I scraped the website).

## How do I use the project?
### Analysis
For analysis, you would first have to remove all redundant values (which there are alot of).

### Set it up on your own
If you want to set it up on your own, then the following will explain how you do it on Windows 10, Python 3.8. This guide may be incomplete since I'm working from memory

1) Fork repository
2) Download and install the python packages: 
    - pandas
